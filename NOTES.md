## AR JS

Home slide - I'm Ali -- lead instructor + distinguished faculty at GA - I teach people to be software engineers

## Roadmap

## What is AR?

* We have some sort of interaction between the real world and the computer.
* You may have had virtual reality -- starts at or close to zero and creates a whole new world.

## Next
* AR allows you to visualize the real world with more added to it, which is really cool.

## Why me?
* I'm not an expert in AR. You are probably disappointed, but that's actually why I'm talking about it. I was super intimidated by it, I thought I'd have to know all sorts of math + graphics programming, or a different language. Turns out that wasn't true.

* Saw an article on re-creating Snapchat filters in Python -- I thought it would be even cooler to make something web ready. If I can write the code in JavaScript, anyone can access it.

* I looked up a bunch of stuff and then wrote an article on it. and then people started asking me to speak about it, so now I am a little bit of an expert i guess

## Where is AR being used?

## WHEN WILL WE USE AR EVERY DAY?

* Some people are.
* Mostly teenage girls and young women. Not necessarily the programmer demographic, but people like me.

## Demos!

## Marker-based

## Markerless
Location, sounds, just adding things to the world

## PROJECTION

Something projected into the real world, like the climbing example, potentially car dashboards

## SUPERIMPOSITION
Create a thing that's shown on top of the real world -- Ikea for ex. 

## HOw can you write AR apps for the web?

Aframe + ARJS - HTML, fully functional app in 10 lines HTML. Marker based. 

## Tracking JS + other libraries
